### Hi, I'm whirlygig!

My name is [Emily Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whirlygig/) and I like doing front-end work. Check out my [senior project](https://whirlygig.github.io/senior-project/), a website made in React that simulates a desktop and many applications that come with a regular  operating system. I've also worked with [Bridge](https://bridgemh.com/), a small mental health-based startup in San Luis Obispo, and with the [Global Program for Safer Schools](https://gpss.worldbank.org/) on a wireframe for a dashboard to simplify their data input.

I'm a recent Cal Poly Software Engineering graduate. Here's some of the classes I took:
- Intro to Entrepreneurship
- Software Engineering I & II
- Individual Software Design & Development
- Interactive Entertainment Engineering
- User-Centered Interface Design & Development
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Senior Project
- Software Engineering Capstone (Software Requirements Engineering, Software Construction, Software Deployment)

My interests outside of programming include learning about accessibility, making art and playing video games (especially Nintendo games). Feel free to ask me about them! âœ¨
